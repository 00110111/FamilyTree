\section*{Installation}

Installation of Family Tree is pretty simple. You just have to follow the following steps\-: \begin{DoxyVerb}1) Clone the repository to your Apache Document Root for eg. in my case (/var/www)

    Execute the following command to clone the repository

        $ git clone https://github.com/piyushparkash/FamilyTree.git

2) Now open the browser and open the Directory

    After the cloning repository a folder named FamilyTree will be created in your document root

    with path that will look something like this (/var/www/FamilyTree)

    Then you can write the following in browser http://localhost/FamilyTree/

3) The very first step is to give permissions to certains folders which FamilyTree requires

    These folders are FamilyTree, FamilyTree/template/cache, FamilyTree/template/compile

    Note: If these folder are not already present then you will have to create it manually
\end{DoxyVerb}
